Step 2: Data Understanding
We used rich datasets found through Kaggle public database. Here’s how we’ll use them:
Netflix User Base:
Identify user demographics, subscription type, and payment patterns.
All_Clickstream:
Analyze navigation patterns and engagement (e.g., browsing, movie details, playback).
All_Devices:
Understand device usage and its correlation with user activity.
All_Profiles:
Segment profiles by language, maturity level, and privacy settings.
All_SearchHistory:
Explore search trends and interaction types.
All_ViewingActivity:
Analyze viewing behaviors (frequency, session duration, titles watched).
netflix_titles:
Enrich user data with content metadata (genres, release year, etc.).

Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preparation
Real world data is messy. We conducted several comprehensive cleaning and preparation analytical techniques to optimize our data for analysis.
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing or inconsistent data (e.g., missing playback dates, profile transfer details).
Standardize date formats across all datasets.
Feature Engineering:
Engagement Metrics: Total viewing time, number of searches, playback frequency.
Subscription Patterns: Time since the last payment, subscription changes.
Content Preferences: Most-watched genres, preferred content rating (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13).
Behavioral Trends: Frequency of navigation actions, abandoned searches.
Data Merging:
Combine datasets based on User ID or Profile Name to create a unified dataset.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn Definition:
Users who haven’t made a payment in the last 30 days or more.
Visualizations:
Age distribution, device usage, and churn rate by subscription type.
Engagement metrics for churned vs. retained users.
Correlation Analysis:
Identify key drivers of churn (e.g., low engagement, device type).

Step 5: Model Building
Target Variable: Churn (1 = churned, 0 = retained).
Model Pipeline:
Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
Use techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) if data is imbalanced.
Model Selection:
Logistic Regression (baseline model).
Random Forest or Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) for performance.
Feature Importance:
Use SHAP or permutation importance to explain model predictions.

Step 6: Evaluation
Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
Cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Analyze false positives/negatives to fine-tune the model.

Step 7: Deployment
Retention Dashboard:
Use analytical techniques to visualize:
Churn predictions.
Key drivers of churn.
Segmented retention strategies.
Automated Alerts:
Set up alerts for users at high risk of churn.
Retention Campaigns:
Provide insights for personalized retention campaigns (e.g., discounts, content recommendations).

Step 8: Documentation and Portfolio
Deliverables:
Technical report outlining the model and findings.
GitHub repository with all code, datasets (if permissible), and documentation.
Interactive dashboard for recruiters to explore your work.
